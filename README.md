# Wechsel
Organise your projects by replacing user folders with symlinks to project folders.

Anoyed by the mess in your Download or Desktop folder?

Wechsel is a simple tool that helps you by giving you an individual Download, Desktop, ... folder for each project.
It replaces the original folders with symlinks to the folders of the current active project.
Like this the random files you download, they will be placed in the Download folder they belong to.

Additionaly each project can have init scripts that allow you to do things like automaticly sourcing python enviroments in your python projects.
